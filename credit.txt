Do the following to get credit:

* Commit your generated romeo-and-juliet.pdf from hw8
* Fix the indentation problem in electionHW7.py so that it runs correctly from tests.py, and commit it to your github repo.
* Write and submit your self-eval and faculty evals for me, neal, and SHerri online at my.evergreen.edu

Do this by 5pm tomorrow (Friday).

Thanks, Paul

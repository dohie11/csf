Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.3
CG-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

Line40, in <module> , name'linenum' is not defined. In addition, line 31 is not defined. Because of putting the # character
in front of 'seq' and 'linenum' the computer can not understand where the 'linenum' from , and what is the value of 'linenum'.

If comment out line 'gc_count = 0" the error will be on line 66 because name ' gc_count' is not defined also. It is similar
with 'seq' and 'linenum' above. gc is count for total , we must give it variable 0 if we want total.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7


Collaboration:

Trong Nguyen ( classmates ) , he just show me how to check the result of problem 4 by hands ..and how to compare with 
"python results "

Reflection:

This exercise is the most of interesting python HW so far. I learned a lot of things from this part such as : command line, 
copy and paste from command promt,... I felt very excited about python now, and ready to learn for new things

Problem 5: Count Nucleotides

G:  5738773
C:  5879128
A:  7701287
T:  7661547


Problem 6:
we have the "Total Count" and the Seg Length" are same, the sum is different. Thats because the sum is count 
for G, C, A, T. However, the total and seg length counts for everything.



Problem 7:

AT-GC Ratio: 0.428571428571

Problem 8:

Collaboration:

I have work Cardin Nguyen for this homework.

Reflection:

I feel that when we work as a team , we can save a lot of time and more easy to understand about the problem.

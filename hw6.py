### Problem 3
### Recognizing Types



Good morning!
['pink', 'yellow', 'green', 'red', 'purple', 'blue', 'orange']
{'Karen': 22, 'Bob': 20, 'Lucy': 21, 'Adam': 21}
[{'January': 1, 'December': 12}, {'January 1st': 'New Years', 'December 25th': 'Christmas'}]


# This is just create a list in dictionary

###
### Problem 4
### Identifying Values With an Index

 
 antelope penguin bear
 
# for problem for the index values starts at zoo(index value).
# for zoo2 its not possible because zoo2 has only 1 item in the list therefore index is only len = 0




###
### Problem 5: An Index Within an Index 
###
#code:
candy = {"sour patch kids":22, "sour gummy worms": 10, "m&ms": 13, "snickers": 1, "laffy taffy": 5}

value_list = candy.values()

for i in range(0, len(value_list)):
    print value_list[i]


#answer:
10
5
13
1
22

###
### Problem 6: Using a For Loop With a Dictionary
### code fixed
drinks = {"redbull": 3, "water": 4, "fresca": 1, "pom tea": 1, "rockstar": 2}

for i in drinks:
    print i

# Answers: For this problem 6, we just use the "for loop" to pull items out 
water
fresca
rockstar
redbull
pom tea



###
### Problem 7: Understanding and Using Assert
###

# This problem use to verify the columns or rows match or not 
# For example:

assert 1 == 0
# this does not verify that it matches. Therefore this program will stop right here.

assert x == x

#this verify that it match therefore the program will continue to excute other codes.
